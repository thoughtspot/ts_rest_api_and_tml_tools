# This example follows best practices to create a new "release" from an existing set of TML files
# The original TML files from the 'dev' environment are replicated on disk, then modified with any
# transformations necessary for the new 'environment' they will be published to
# GUIDs from the new 'environment' are substituted
#

# This assumes that you have named your files on pattern {GUID}.{objectType}.tml or just {GUID}.tml
# We keep the original dev GUID as the filename, regardless of which environment we publish to
# This allows using the GUID mapping file when publishing, even after the GUID has been changed in the YAML of the file

# The output object_type directories will have /new and /update sub-directories, dividing the content
# between files that match to existing objects in the new environment (update) vs. those
# that will generate new GUIDs that must be added to the mapping file
