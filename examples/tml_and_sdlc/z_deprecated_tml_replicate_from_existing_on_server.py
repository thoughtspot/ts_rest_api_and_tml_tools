# NOTE ON JOINS (also noted in README):
# To ensure that TML publishing works,
# you should manually add some type of random number or alphanumeric to the end of the automatically generated JOIN name
# so that every JOIN has a unique name.
# Ex. If you have a JOIN named "DIM_TABLE_1_DIM_TABLE_2", press "Edit"
# and rename to: "DIM_TABLE_1_DIM_TABLE_2_z1Tl" or some other pattern that guarantees uniqueness.
# If you do not, you may see errors when Importing Table or Worksheet TML because the system cannot resolve JOIN names
# if there are duplicates
