# NOTE ON DEPRECATION
This repository is deprecated, no code hosted here is supported or recommended for use. 

The CS Tools package (https://github.com/thoughtspot/cs_tools) provides built out command-line tools for a wide variety of use cases that you might use ThoughtSpot REST API and TML capabilities for.

For customizable REST API or TML scripting use cases, please see https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_tml and https://github.com/thoughtspot/thoughtspot_rest_api_v1_python for the current examples using the up-to-date versions of those libraries. 

If you have used this package previously, two previously included components have now been split off into their own modules (`thoughtspot_rest_api_v1` and `thoughtspot_tml`, which can be installed from PyPi using pip. Both modules have been added to the requirements.txt and setup.cfg and should be installed to use ts_rest_api_and_tml_tools.

Code originally taken from this repository only works with the 1.2.0/1.3.0 release of thoughtspot_tml, and will not be updated here to reflect the new 2.0 releases and their changed interfaces.
